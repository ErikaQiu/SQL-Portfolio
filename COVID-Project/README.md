### SQL COVID Data Analysis Project
#### Description
This project is focused on analyzing COVID-19 data through a series of SQL queries to uncover insights related to the pandemic's impact across different regions. The analysis covers various aspects, including vaccination rates, infection and mortality rates, and the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns against the spread and fatal outcomes of the disease. By examining data from multiple perspectives—such as comparing total cases versus deaths, analyzing population versus infection rates, and looking at vaccination statistics—we aim to provide a comprehensive view of the pandemic's global and local effects.

#### Data Source
The data used in this project is organized into two main tables: VACCINATIONS and DEATHS. These tables include detailed records of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination progress by location and date.

#### Key Queries
General Overview: Retrieve basic information from the VACCINATIONS and DEATHS tables.
Total Cases vs. Total Deaths: Analyze the death ratio to total cases for insights into the pandemic's lethality.
Population vs. Total Cases: Investigate the infection rate relative to the population size in different locations.
Max Infected Countries: Identify countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population.
Countries with Highest Deaths: List countries and continents with the highest death counts to see where the pandemic has been most deadly.
Vaccination Analysis: Join VACCINATIONS and DEATHS data to analyze vaccination rates and their impact over time.
Advanced Analysis: Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables for more complex analyses, such as the rolling total of people vaccinated.
#### Insights and Findings
This section can be used to summarize key insights, trends, and any surprising findings from your analysis. Discuss how vaccination rates correlate with infection and mortality rates, regional differences in pandemic impact, and any other significant patterns observed in the data.
