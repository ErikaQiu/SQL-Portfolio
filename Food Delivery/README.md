# Canadian Food Delivery Insights SQL Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the food delivery service data in 8 populous Canadian cities. The aim is to extract insights from the restaurants offering delivery under 30 minutes from an iconic downtown location in each city.

## Dataset

The dataset is organized into 6 tables:
- `Restaurant`: Information about the restaurants including name and delivery details.
- `City`: Details of the cities covered in the study.
- `Price`: Pricing data for menu items.
- `Reviews`: Customer reviews for each restaurant.
- `Restaurant_Category`: Categories of the restaurants such as American, Chinese, etc.

Variables include the restaurantsâ€™ name, number of reviews of each restaurant, delivery time, and distance, among others.

## Key Questions Explored

- Which restaurant has the longest average delivery time, and what is that time across different restaurant categories?
- How does the restaurant with the highest number of reviews in each city compare with the city's average?

## Insights Gained

The analysis has revealed that certain categories, notably American (Traditional), could significantly enhance their delivery efficiency. A detailed case study on 'Eggspectation' demonstrates how addressing lengthy delivery times could improve service offerings.

## Visualization

The results are visualized in Tableau, providing an interactive way to explore the data and insights.

## Repository Structure

- `sql_queries/` - This directory contains all the SQL query files used to extract data from the database.
- `tableau_visualizations/` - Contains the Tableau workbook files with all the visualizations.
